Hello! My name is Shar Siddiqui and I am a freshwater ecosystem scientist with an interest in applying data science and GIS towards better understanding ecosystem disturbance and integrity. I am also very interested using open reproducible data pipelines to promote science communication. Here's a few examples of data visualization that have come out of my PhD and early career hydrology research. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or inquiries!

Here's a plot I generated for #TidyTuesday while working at the USGS DataViz Lab
![This plot uses a paired half-rainfall and half-density plot to show the variation in households with plumbing by region. The plot of variation is paired with an inset map to show where those regions are located. Variation can be easily and beautifully plotted with the use of the ggdist package](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/static/tidycensus-viz/tidycensus-viz-sharmin.png)

This is a figure from the first chapter of my dissertation, which coalesces 400 gauges across the Amazon and hierarchical clustering to create a flow regime classifiation.
