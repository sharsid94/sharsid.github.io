Hello! Here's a few examples of data visualization that have come out of my PhD and early career hydrology research. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or inquiries!

![This plot uses a paired half-rainfall and half-density plot to show the variation in households with plumbing by region. The plot of variation is paired with an inset map to show where those regions are located. Variation can be easily and beautifully plotted with the use of the ggdist package](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/static/tidycensus-viz/tidycensus-viz-sharmin.png)
